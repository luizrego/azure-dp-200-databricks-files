Delta Lake brings ACID transactions to your data lakes. It provides serializability, the strongest level of isolation level.\n\n**Scalable Metadata Handling**:\nIn big data, even the metadata itself can be \"big data\". Delta Lake treats metadata just like data, leveraging Spark's distributed processing power to handle all its metadata. As a result, Delta Lake can handle petabyte-scale tables with billions of partitions and files at ease.\n\n**Time Travel (data versioning)**:\nDelta Lake provides snapshots of data enabling developers to access and revert to earlier versions of data for audits, rollbacks or to reproduce experiments.\n\n**Open Format**:\nAll data in Delta Lake is stored in Apache Parquet format enabling Delta Lake to leverage the efficient compression and encoding schemes that are native to Parquet.\n\n**Unified Batch and Streaming Source and Sink**:\nA table in Delta Lake is both a batch table, as well as a streaming source and sink. Streaming data ingest, batch historic backfill, and interactive queries all just work out of the box.\n\n**Schema Enforcement**:\nDelta Lake provides the ability to specify your schema and enforce it. This helps ensure that the data types are correct and required columns are present, preventing bad data from causing data corruption.\n\n**Schema Evolution**:\nBig data is continuously changing. Delta Lake enables you to make changes to a table schema that can be applied automatically, without the need for cumbersome DDL.\n\n**100% Compatible with Apache Spark API**:\nDevelopers can use Delta Lake with their existing data pipelines with minimal change as it is fully compatible with Spark, the commonly used big data processing engine."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Getting Started\n\nYou will notice that throughout this course, there is a lot of context switching between PySpark/Scala and SQL.\n\nThis is because:\n* `read` and `write` operations are performed on DataFrames using PySpark or Scala\n* table creates and queries are performed directly off Delta Lake tables using SQL\n\nRun the following cell to configure our \"classroom.\""],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%run \"./Includes/Classroom-Setup\""],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":4},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["-sandbox\n<h2><img src=\"https://files.training.databricks.com/images/105/logo_spark_tiny.png\"> Key Concepts: Delta Lake Architecture</h2>\n\n<img alt=\"Side Note\" title=\"Side Note\" style=\"vertical-align: text-bottom; position: relative; height:1.75em; top:0.05em; transform:rotate(15deg)\" src=\"https://files.training.databricks.com/static/images/icon-note.webp\"/> We'll touch on this further in future notebooks.\n\nThroughout our Delta Lake discussions, we'll often refer to the concept of Bronze/Silver/Gold tables.
