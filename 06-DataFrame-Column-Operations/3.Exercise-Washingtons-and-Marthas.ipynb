Filter the result to the **en** Wikipedia project.\n0. Find all the articles where the name of the article **ends** with **_Washington** (presumably \"George Washington\", \"Martha Washington\", etc)\n0. Return all records as an array to the Driver.\n0. Assign your array of Washingtons (the return value of your action) to the variable `washingtons`.\n0. Calculate the sum of requests for the Washingtons and assign it to the variable `totalWashingtons`. <br/>\n<img alt=\"Hint\" title=\"Hint\" style=\"vertical-align: text-bottom; position: relative; height:1.75em; top:0.3em\" src=\"https://files.training.databricks.com/static/images/icon-light-bulb.svg\"/>&nbsp;**Hint:** We've not yet covered `DataFrame` aggregation techniques, so for this exercise use the array of records you have just obtained.\n\n** Bonus **\n\nRepeat the exercise for the Marthas\n0. Filter the result to the **en** Wikipedia project.\n0. Find all the articles where the name of the article **starts** with **Martha_** (presumably \"Martha Washington\", \"Martha Graham\", etc)\n0. Return all records as an array to the Driver.\n0. Assign your array of Marthas (the return value of your action) to the variable `marthas`.\n0.

But you cannot do it the same way twice:\n   * In the filter, don't use the same conditional method as the one used for the Washingtons.\n   * Don't use the same action as used for the Washingtons.\n\n**Testing**\n\nRun the last cell to verify that your results are correct.\n\n**Hints**\n* <img alt=\"Caution\" title=\"Caution\" style=\"vertical-align: text-bottom; position: relative; height:1.3em; top:0.0em\" src=\"https://files.training.databricks.com/static/images/icon-warning.svg\"/> Make sure to include the underscore in the condition.\n* The actions we've explored for extracting data include:\n  * `first()`\n  * `collect()`\n  * `head()`\n  * `take(n)`\n* The conditional methods used with a `filter(..)` include:\n  * equals\n  * not-equals\n  * starts-with\n  * and there are others - remember, the `DataFrames` API is built upon an SQL engine.\n* There shouldn't be more than 1000 records for either the Washingtons or the Marthas"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##![Spark Logo Tiny](https://files.training.databricks.com/images/105/logo_spark_tiny.png) Getting Started\n\nRun the following cell to configure our \"classroom.\""],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%run \"./Includes/Classroom-Setup\""],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":4},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##![Spark Logo Tiny](https://files.training.databricks.com/images/wiki-book/general/logo_spark_tiny.png) Show Your Work"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["(source, sasEntity, sasToken) = getAzureDataSource()\nspark.conf.set(sasEntity, sasToken)\n\nparquetDir = source + \"/wikipedia/pagecounts/staging_parquet_en_only_clean/\""],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":6},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# TODO\n\n# Replace FILL_IN with your code.
