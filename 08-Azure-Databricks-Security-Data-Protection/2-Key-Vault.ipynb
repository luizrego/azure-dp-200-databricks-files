In this notebook, we'll focus on configuring an access policy and creating Secrets. These instructions are based around configurations and settings for the ADB Core partner training, but should be adaptable to production requirements.\n\n**This is something that will generally be handled by the workspace adminstrator.** Only individuals with proper permissions in the Azure Active Directory will be able to link a Key Vault to the Databricks workspace. (Each Key Vault will map to a \"scope\" in Databricks, so enterprise solutions may have many different Key Vaults for different teams/personas who need different permissions.)\n\n### Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this lesson, you should be able to:\n- Configure Key Vault Access Policies\n- Create Secrets that store SAS Tokens in a Key Vault"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["-sandbox\n\n<img alt=\"Caution\" title=\"Caution\" style=\"vertical-align: text-bottom; position: relative; height:1.3em; top:0.0em\" src=\"https://files.training.databricks.com/static/images/icon-warning.svg\"/> **PLEASE** open a new browser tab and navigate to <https://portal.azure.com>."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Configure Key Vault Access Policies\n\n1.
